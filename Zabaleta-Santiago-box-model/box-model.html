   		<h3><a name="creation">Creation</a></h3>
   		<p>In early December 1891, Canadian American Dr. James Naismith,[2] a physical education professor and
instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School[3] (YMCA) (today,
Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA), was trying to keep his gym class active on
a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of
fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or
poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a
10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained
its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved
inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed,[4] allowing the balls to be poked out
with a long dowel each time. 
<br><br>Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. The first balls
made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle,
searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the
orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the
"bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was
eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a
major part of the game around the 1950s, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.<br><br> The peach baskets
were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further
change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the
basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.[5] The baskets
were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical
when spectators on the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to
prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.[6] Naismith's
handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous
about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called "Duck on
a Rock", as many had failed before it. Naismith called the new game "Basket Ball".[7] The first
official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York on January 20, 1892 with nine
players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the
size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court. By 1897–1898 teams
of five became standard.</p>
   		<h3><a name="rules">Rules And Regulations</a></h3>
   		<p>Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA)[26] or 12 minutes (NBA).[27] College games use two
20-minute halves,[28] while United States high school varsity games use 8 minute quarters.[29] 15
minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules[28][30][31] and 10 minutes
in United States high schools.[29] Overtime periods are five minutes in length[28][32][33] except
for high school which is four minutes in length.[29] Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The
time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore,
games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.
<br><br>Five players from each team may be on the court at one time.[34][35][36][37] Substitutions are
unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped. Teams also have a coach, who oversees the
development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches,
managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers. <br><br>For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform
consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the team,
printed on both the front and back. Players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support.
Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the
uniforms.<br><br> A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated
in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than
one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.<br><br> The
game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the
NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For college,
the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table
officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring, timekeeping, individual and team
fouls, player substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock.</p>
   		<h3><a name="social_forms">Social Forms of Basketball</a></h3>
   		
   		<p>Basketball has been adopted by various social groups, which have established their own environments and sometimes their own rules. Such socialized forms of basketball include the following.
   		<br><br>
   		<ul>
   		<div id="list">
<li>Recreational basketball, where fun, entertainment and camaraderie rule rather than winning a game;</li>
<li>Basketball Schools and Academies, where students are trained in developing basketball fundamentals, undergo fitness and endurance exercises and learn various basketball skills. Basketball students learn proper ways of passing, ball handling, dribbling, shooting from various distances, rebounding, offensive moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball rules and basketball ethics. Also popular are the basketball camps organized for various occasions, often to get prepared for basketball events, and basketball clinics for improving skills.</li>
<li>College and University basketball played in educational institutions of higher learning.</li>
<li>Ethnic and Religion-based basketball: Examples of ethnic basketball include Indo-Pak or Russian or Armenian leagues in the United States or Canada, for example, or Filipino expatriate basketball leagues in the Gulf or the United States. Religion-based basketball includes, most notably, church-related Christian basketball leagues, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu basketball leagues, and so on. or denominational leagues like Coptic, Syriac/Assyrian basketball leagues in the United States or Canada.</li>

   		<h3><a name="fantasy_b">Fantasy Football</a></h3>
   		<p>Fantasy basketball was inspired by fantasy baseball. Originally played by keeping track of stats by
hand, it was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Those who play this game
are sometimes referred to as General Managers, who draft actual NBA players and compute their
basketball statistics. The game was popularized by ESPN Fantasy Sports, NBA.com, and Yahoo! Fantasy
Sports. Other sports websites provided the same format keeping the game interesting with
participants actually owning specific players.</p>
