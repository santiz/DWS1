   		<h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
   		<ul>
   		<li>6 garlic cloves, pressed or grated</li>
   		<li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
   		<li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
   		<li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
   		<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
   		<li>3/4 pound medium shrimp (21 to 25), peeled, deveined and butterflied (reserve shells)</li>
   		<li>1/4 onion</li>
   		<li>3/4 pound thin linguini</li>
   		<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
   		<li>1 small bunch parsley, leaves chopped</li>
   		
   		</ul>
   		<h4>Directions</h4>
   		<ol>
   		<li>In a bowl, combine the garlic, zest and juice of 1 lemon, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, to taste, and the shrimp. Set aside to marinate.</li>
   		<li>Meanwhile make a quick shrimp stock: In a small pot, over medium heat, add the shrimp shells and onion. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain into a bowl and discard the shells and the onion.</li>
   		<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and add a generous amount of salt. Add the linguini and cook until just tender, 2 minutes less than instructed on the package. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water</li>
   		<li>Heat a skillet over high heat. Remove the shrimp from the marinade, reserve the marinade, and add the shrimp to the skillet. Cook until they turn pink and start to caramelize, about 3 minutes. </li>
   		<li>Remove the shrimp from the pan to a plate and add the reserved marinade. Let cook a few minutes then add about 1 cup of shrimp stock and about 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
   		<li>Continue to cook until sauce reduces by half. Add the zest and juice of the remaining lemon, the butter and the parsley and stir to combine. </li>
   		<li>Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, to taste. </li>
   		<li>Add in the shrimp and pasta and toss to combine with the sauce. Turn out into a serving bowl and serve immediately.</li>
   		</ol>
