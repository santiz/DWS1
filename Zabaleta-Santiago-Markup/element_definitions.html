   		<h2>Chapter 2 Text</h2>
   			<dl>
  			<dt>Headings (&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;, etc)</dt>
  			<dd>These Heading Tags, describe structure within a document. From, most important, to least. Also can be used to describe the order in which things are read. &lt;h1&gt; being the main heading, and followed by &lt;h2&gt; and so on.  </dd>
  			<dt>Paragraph (&lt;p&gt;)</dt>
  			<dd>Is the symbol used in order to tell the browser to incase that specific group of text within the &ldquo;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&rdquo; tags, into a paragraph, and anything within, is a paragraph indeed.</dd>
			<dt>Bold & Italic (&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;)</dt>
			<dd>The &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags are used to create text that is <b>bold like this</b> or text that is <i>italicized, like this</i>. This provides the user whom is reading it with the true meaning of what the specific word or paragraph is describing in its true sense. </dd>
			<dt>Superscript &lt;sup&gt;  and Subscript &lt;sub&gt;</dt>
			<dd>&lt;sup&gt; is the element used to describe symbols such as: " <sup>th</sup> " when describing suffix or a mathematical number raised to a certain power. While the &lt;sub&gt; tag defines a subscript, meaning something such as a footnote or a chemical formula like H<sub>2</sub>O.</dd>
			<dt>Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules</dt>
			<dd>Line breaks can be used when one, wants to break a line from a paragraph or a group of text, using the &lt;br /&gt; tag. One can also use a certain element, to add a line break using the &lt;hr /&gt; tag, these especially come in handy when you want to break text into a new topic for example. </dd>
			<dt>Strong &lt;strong&gt; and Emphasis &lt;em&gt;</dt>
			<dd>These type of tags provide a feel to the way the sentence or the group of text is read. It does a similar job to Italicized text or Bold text. </dd>
			<dt>Quotations</dt>
			<dd>If you wanted to quote a really long quote, you would use the &lt;blockquote&gt; tag to emphasize that to the user.</dd>
			<dt>Abbreviations and Acronyms</dt>
			<dd>The abbreviations &lt;abbr&gt; tag, can be used in the document, to quickly abbreviate things like Professor, Boulevard, or other words that tend to get abbreviated. Whereas the &lt;acronym&gt; tag can be used to abbreviated departments such as NASA, DEA, FBI, and others alike. Which would show the full meaning on mouse roll over: <acronym title="Federal Investigations Bureau">FBI</acronym>.</dd>
			<dt>Citations and Definitions</dt>
			<dd>A &lt;cite&gt; tag would italicize the given words into a citation, which you would use to reference a book or a given address of a specific document one was referring to. Now if you were defining a specific term within a document, you can always assign a &lt;dfn&gt; tag, which is used to define the instance of that object. </dd>
			<dt>Author Details or the &lt;address&gt; tag </dt>
			<dd>This tag can specifically be used to identify personal details of the specific author. Doesn't necessarily mean to give an address within this tag, but can be used for many different options.</dd>
			<dt>Changes to Content</dt>
			<dd>The &lt;ins&gt; & &lt;del&gt; can be used to insert and delete previous recorded text within the document. The &lt;ins&gt; tag simply inserts a new word after whatever word you added the &lt;del&gt; tag. The &lt;del&gt; will put a line across the <del>specific</del> word, while the &lt;ins&gt; <ins>underlines</ins> it.</dd>
			
			</dl>
   		<h2>Chapter 3 List</h2>
   			<dl>
   			<dt>Ordered and Unordered List</dt>
			<dd>Both type of lists require their own individual elements. &lt;ol&gt; for ordered and &lt;ul&gt; for unordered list. The ordered list tag, will put everything in a specific number count, while the unordered list will make a bullet out of it. In both settings, you need your &lt;li&gt; tag to create that specific instance within that list as well.</dd>
			<dt>Definition List</dt>
			<dd>A definition list is in effect at the moment, within this very document. It's triggered by your &lt;dl&gt; tag, which creates the body for the terms. Then, it also consists of two elements; &lt;dt&gt;, which is the term being defined and &lt;dd&gt;, which defines the term.</dd>
			<dt>Nested List use the same concepts as the unordered list (same elements), except they are within the same list. so you would add an additional &lt;li&gt; tag within an original &lt;li&gt; tag to create a list that is nested.</dt>
